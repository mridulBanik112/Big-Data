# Attribute-based Image Retrieval using Convolutional Neural Networks â€‹

In this project, we have implemented an efficient image retrieval system that focuses on high accuracy and tries to identify any (possible) relations with the images already known. Considering that images take up a sizable portion of the total data generated every year due to various social media platforms, they have become an especially important part of our lives. Hence, it seems interesting how images have a trend and what useful information can be extracted just by looking at the images generated.
